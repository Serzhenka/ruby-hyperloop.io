# Hyperloop Gems

Hyperloop is a family of gems which collectively make up the missing Ruby Front End library. Isomorphic programming for those who love Ruby.

**Note:** The Hyperloop gems are in a process of being renamed. The links below will take you to the correct Github projects but you might find the name of the project does not quite match the name of the gem on this page. This will be addressed over time as the gems are renamed.

## Installation Gems

See [Installation](/installation) for further installation options.

#### [Hyperloop Express](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/reactrb-express)

Hyper-react for static sites, with no build process needed.

#### [Hyperloop Rails](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/reactrb-rails-generator)

One step integration of Hyper-react, Hyper-mesh and Hyper-router with Rails plus generators for Components and Routers.

## Hyperloop  Gems

See [Docs](/docs/dsl_overview) for detailed information on how to use these gems or [Tutorials](/tutorials) for working examples.

#### [Hyper-react](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/reactrb)

This is the master gem. You will always need this as a base. Hyper-react provides a Ruby DSL to Facebook's React. Much of the documentation on this site covers usage of this Gem.

#### [Hyper-router](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/reactrb-router/tree/v2-4-0)

Hyper-router provides a Ruby DSL to Facebook's React Router which is a React component that loads other components depending on the current URL.

#### [Hyper-mesh](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/synchromesh)

Hyper-mesh is a policy based CRUD system which wraps ActiveRecord models on the server and extends them to the client. Furthermore it implements push notifications (via a number of possible technologies) so changes to records in use by clients are pushed to those clients if authorised. Isomorphic Ruby in action.

## Tools and Deubgging

See [Tools and Debugging](/tools/) for further information.

#### [Hyper-trace](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-trace)

Method tracing and conditional breakpoints for Opal Ruby.

#### [Opal Hot Reloader](https://github.com/fkchang/opal-hot-reloader)

For pure programmer joy, no more page refreshes.

#### [Opal Console](https://github.com/fkchang/opal-console)

Opal in your browser. Great for testing.
