**Note:** The Hyperloop gems are in a process of being renamed. The links below will take you to the correct Github projects but you might find the name of the project does not quite match the name of the gem on this page. This will be addressed over time as the gems are renamed. HyperReact was previously known as HyperReact.

There are two main tutorials on this site:

+ [Chat-App Tutorial](/tutorials/chat_app) will teach you the basics of building a HyperReact application that runs purely in your browser with no need for any back end system (like Rails, Node or Sinatra). This work-along tutorial is an excellent place to start to learn the HyperReact DSL without needing to learn how to install it. If you have not used the HyperReact DSL before then this is an **excellent place to start.**

+ [Hyperloop Technology Showcase Tutorial](/tutorials/showcase) builds a simple Rails application showcasing HyperReact, Opal, NPM, Webpack, React Bootstrap, Reactive Record, Synchromesh, Rearcrb Router and other associated technologies. This tutorial will show how the **Hyperloop technologies work together.**
