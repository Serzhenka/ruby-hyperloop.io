Reactrb is a wrapper for the React.js library for creating user interfaces.  Reactrb provides all the goodness of React combined with the expressiveness of the Ruby language.   

React was built to solve one problem: **building large applications with data that changes over time**.

Reactrb takes this one step further.  Because its uses Ruby, you can think in one language on the server and the client.  Because it uses React.js you get a simple, declarative, structured way to build your UI.

## Simple

You express how your app should look at any given point in time, and React will automatically manage all UI updates when your underlying data changes.

## Declarative

When the data changes, React conceptually hits the "refresh" button, and knows to only update the changed parts.

## Build Composable Components

React is all about building reusable components. In fact, with React the *only* thing you do is build components. Since they're so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.
