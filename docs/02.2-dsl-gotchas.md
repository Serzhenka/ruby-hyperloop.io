There are few gotchas with the DSL you should be aware of:

> For DOM differences, such as the inline `style` attribute, check [here](/docs/dom-differences.html).

## HTML Entities

If you want to display an HTML entity within dynamic content, you will run into double escaping issues as React.js escapes all the strings you are displaying in order to prevent a wide range of XSS attacks by default.

```ruby
# Bad: It displays "First &middot; Second"
div {'First &middot; Second' }
```

To workaround this you have to [insert raw HTML](/react/tips/dangerously-set-inner-html.html).

```ruby
div(dangerously_set_inner_HTML: { __html: "First &middot; Second"})
```

## Custom HTML Attributes

If you pass properties to native HTML elements that do not exist in the HTML specification, React will not render them. If you want to use a custom attribute, you should prefix it with `data-`.

```ruby
div("data-custom-attribute" => "foo")
```

[Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) attributes starting with `aria-` will be rendered properly.

```ruby
div("aria-hidden" => true)
```

### Invoking Application Components

When invoking a custom component you must have a (possibly empty) parameter list or (possibly empty) block.  This is not necessary
with standard html tags.

```ruby
MyCustomComponent()  # okay
MyCustomComponent {} # okay
MyCustomComponent    # breaks
br                   # okay
```
