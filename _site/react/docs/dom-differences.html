<p>React has implemented a browser-independent events and DOM system for performance and cross-browser compatibility reasons. We took the opportunity to clean up a few rough edges in browser DOM implementations.</p>

<ul>
<li>All DOM properties and attributes (including event handlers) should be camelCased to be consistent with standard JavaScript style. We intentionally break with the spec here since the spec is inconsistent. <strong>However</strong>, <code>data-*</code> and <code>aria-*</code> attributes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#data-*">conform to the specs</a> and should be lower-cased only.</li>
<li>The <code>style</code> attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This is consistent with the DOM <code>style</code> JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.</li>
<li>All event objects conform to the W3C spec, and all events (including submit) bubble correctly per the W3C spec. See <a href="/react/docs/events.html">Event System</a> for more details.</li>
<li>The <code>onChange</code> event behaves as you would expect it to: whenever a form field is changed this event is fired rather than inconsistently on blur. We intentionally break from existing browser behavior because <code>onChange</code> is a misnomer for its behavior and React relies on this event to react to user input in real time. See <a href="/react/docs/forms.html">Forms</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Form input attributes such as <code>value</code> and <code>checked</code>, as well as <code>textarea</code>. <a href="/react/docs/forms.html">More here</a>.</li>
</ul>
