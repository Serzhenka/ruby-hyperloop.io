<p>The React add-ons are a collection of useful utility modules for building React apps. <strong>These should be considered experimental</strong> and tend to change more often than the core.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="animation.html"><code>TransitionGroup</code> and <code>CSSTransitionGroup</code></a>, for dealing with animations and transitions that are usually not simple to implement, such as before a component&#39;s removal.</li>
<li><a href="two-way-binding-helpers.html"><code>LinkedStateMixin</code></a>, to simplify the coordination between user&#39;s form input data and the component&#39;s state.</li>
<li><a href="clone-with-props.html"><code>cloneWithProps</code></a>, to make shallow copies of React components and change their props.</li>
<li><a href="create-fragment.html"><code>createFragment</code></a>, to create a set of externally-keyed children.</li>
<li><a href="update.html"><code>update</code></a>, a helper function that makes dealing with immutable data in JavaScript easier.</li>
<li><a href="pure-render-mixin.html"><code>PureRenderMixin</code></a>, a performance booster under certain situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The add-ons below are in the development (unminified) version of React only:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="test-utils.html"><code>TestUtils</code></a>, simple helpers for writing test cases (unminified build only).</li>
<li><a href="perf.html"><code>Perf</code></a>, for measuring performance and giving you hint where to optimize.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get the add-ons, install them individually from npm (e.g., <code>npm install react-addons-pure-render-mixin</code>). We don&#39;t support using the addons if you&#39;re not using npm.</p>
