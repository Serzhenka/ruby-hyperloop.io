<p>React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the <strong>V</strong> in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a></strong>.</p>

<p>We built React to solve one problem: <strong>building large applications with data that changes over time</strong>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="simple"></a>Simple <a class="hash-link" href="#simple">#</a></h2>
<p>Simply express how your app should look at any given point in time, and React will automatically manage all UI updates when your underlying data changes.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="declarative"></a>Declarative <a class="hash-link" href="#declarative">#</a></h2>
<p>When the data changes, React conceptually hits the &quot;refresh&quot; button, and knows to only update the changed parts.</p>

<p>React is all about building reusable components. In fact, with React the <em>only</em> thing you do is build components. Since they&#39;re so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.</p>

<p>React challenges a lot of conventional wisdom, and at first glance some of the ideas may seem crazy. <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">Give it five minutes</a> while reading this guide; those crazy ideas have worked for building thousands of components both inside and outside of Facebook and Instagram.</p>
