<p>Beside <a href="/react/docs/dom-differences.html">DOM differences</a>, React offers some attributes that simply don&#39;t exist in DOM.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>key</code>: an optional, unique identifier. When your component shuffles around during <code>render</code> passes, it might be destroyed and recreated due to the diff algorithm. Assigning it a key that persists makes sure the component stays. See more <a href="/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-children">here</a>.</li>
<li><code>ref</code>: see <a href="/react/docs/more-about-refs.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code>: Provides the ability to insert raw HTML, mainly for cooperating with DOM string manipulation libraries. See more <a href="/react/tips/dangerously-set-inner-html.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
